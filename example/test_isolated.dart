/*
"""<start_of_turn>user\nHey everyone,

Iâ€™ve been testing out Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview inside Google AI Studio and Iâ€™m a bit confused about the pricing.

Iâ€™m not using the API or Vertex AI, just playing around in AI Studio (the browser interface). According to the docs, it should be free for nowâ€”but Iâ€™ve seen a few posts from people saying they got charged \$500+ after just a few hours of use. ðŸ˜³

So my question is:
Is Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview actually free in AI Studio right now?
Has anyone here received a bill even though they only used it inside AI Studio?

Just trying to make sure Iâ€™m not missing something that could cost me big later on.

Thanks in advance!\n<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n
